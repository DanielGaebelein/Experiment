#### 1. Multi-Behavior Recommendation System

##### 1.1 Single-Behavior Recommendation System



##### 1.1 Learn from Implicit Data
Implicit feedback can indirectly reflect user preferences by referring to watching videos, buying products, and clicking on items. Compared to explicit feedback (i.e. rating and comments), implicit feedback can be tracked automatically, which makes it easier for content providers to collect. Using implicit feedback also allow us to get much more data than explicit feedback from users' behaviors.

##### 1.1 Learn from Implicit Data
What we did last semester is to do recommendation learning from implicit data, which measures whether a user interacts with an item. It can be defined as the user–item interaction matrix Y ∈ $R^{M×N}$:
$$y_{ui} = \begin{cases}1, & if\ interaction\ (user\ u,\ item\ i)\ is\ observed;\\0, & otherwise\end{cases}$$
Here a value of 1 for $y_{ui}$ indicates that there is an interaction between user u and item i (like click, view, comments etc.); however, it does not mean u actually likes i. Similarly, a value of 0 does not necessarily mean u does not like i, it can be that the user is not aware of the item. 

##### 1.2 Multi-Behavior recommendation scenarios 



#### 2. Multi-Task Learning

Multi-task learning has been used successfully across all applications of machine learning, from natural language processing and speech recognition to computer vision and drug discovery. MTL comes in many guises: joint learning, learning to learn, and learning with auxiliary tasks are only some names that have been used to refer to it. Generally, as soon as you find yourself optimizing more than one loss function, you are effectively doing multi-task learning (in contrast to single-task learning). In those scenarios, it helps to think about what you are trying to do explicitly in terms of MTL and to draw insights from it.

#### 3. Neural Collaborative Filtering

The model of NeuMF is as following:

- Input layer includes two feature vectors, which represent user u and item i in the form of one hot code. 
- Embedding layer, 4 latent factor matrices P_MF, P_MLP and Q_MF, Q_MLP are relative to the user and item vectors, MF and MLP respectively. 
- Neural CF Layers use User Latent vector and Item Latent vector generated by Embedding Layer as input.
- Output Layer, output the prediction score.



#### 4. Multi-Task Recommendation Based on NCF

NCF可以根据用户的历史行为数据进行端到端的推荐。基于此，我们从两方面将其特性应用到跨领域推荐当中：使用多任务推荐同时优化多个领域行为；提取用户行为中丰富的语义信息以增加推荐的准确性。
