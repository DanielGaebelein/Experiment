#### 1. Multi-Behavior Recommendation System

##### 1.1 Learn from Implicit Data

What we did last semester is to do recommendation learning from implicit data, which measures whether a user interacts with an item. It can be defined as the user–item interaction matrix Y ∈ $R^{M×N}$:
$$y_{ui} = \begin{cases}1, & if\ interaction\ (user\ u,\ item\ i)\ is\ observed;\\0, & otherwise\end{cases}$$
Here a value of 1 for $y_{ui}$ indicates that there is an interaction between user u and item i (like click, view, comments etc.); however, it does not mean u actually likes i. Similarly, a value of 0 does not necessarily mean u does not like i, it can be that the user is not aware of the item. 

##### 1.2 Multi-Behavior recommendation scenarios 



#### 2. Multi-Task Learning

Multi-task learning has been used successfully across all applications of machine learning, from natural language processing and speech recognition to computer vision and drug discovery. MTL comes in many guises: joint learning, learning to learn, and learning with auxiliary tasks are only some names that have been used to refer to it. Generally, as soon as you find yourself optimizing more than one loss function, you are effectively doing multi-task learning (in contrast to single-task learning). In those scenarios, it helps to think about what you are trying to do explicitly in terms of MTL and to draw insights from it.

#### 3. Neural Collaborative Filtering

The model of NeuMF is as following:

- Input layer includes two feature vectors, which represent user u and item i in the form of one hot code. 
- Embedding layer, 4 latent factor matrices P_MF, P_MLP and Q_MF, Q_MLP are relative to the user and item vectors, MF and MLP respectively. 
- Neural CF Layers use User Latent vector and Item Latent vector generated by Embedding Layer as input.
- Output Layer, output the prediction score.
